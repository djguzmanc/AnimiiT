# AnimiiT

## What is AnimiiT
AnimiiT allows you to animate sprites, interacting with translation, rotation and sprite scaling.

### Use
Once you've run the application you will see the interface, it is easy to use because it was made by aiming the better user experience.

You'll find at the right side a gray button (Select sprites folder). This button allows you to charge the folder with the sprites that compose your animatable character.

Now that you have all the sprites, you can add a sprite instance by clicking the plus (+) button. Those instances will appear on the animation screen.

Now it's time to use the TimeLine, but first let me explain you about child sprites: When you're playing with a character, you'll find that if you move the body, all the body parts move too!, in order to optimze time you don't have to animate each sprite so the arms will look like they're attached to the body. If you're adding a sprite that somehow belongs to another sprite, don't click the plus button yet!, first make sure that the sprite instance (the father) is selected, I mean, it's background may be blue.

In order to use the timeline, the first thing you need to do is to select the instance you're going to interpolate. Once the sprite instance is highlighted, you can add a TimePicker by clicking the blue button (Create Picker!), it will be added where the TimeLinePicker (red dashed line) is, add many TimePickers ass you need. Finally, by clicking each TimePicker you can deform the sprite by using the compass visible just at the right bottom corner: Use the right click in order to translate the sprite, left click for rotation. "Interpolation Controls" offer two gray buttons, each one allows you to scale the sprite. 

Don't forget to click the TimePicker you pretend to deform (it will be highlighted with green).
